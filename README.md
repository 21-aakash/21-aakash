### Typical Questions
<details closed>
  <summary>What are your strengths?</summary><br/>
  I am extremely determined and driven to learn. I believe learning is strength and freedom in a way, not to sound cheesy. If I have a problem to solve, then I am right there searching for the answer. Additionally, I believe that I am very patient and am empathetic to others' circumstances. <br/><br/>A simple example would be that if a stranger is rude, in general or in retail, I am not one to take it personally, I don't know their life or how their day has gone. Another could be if someone is speeding, they could be heading to the hospital for all we know.</details>

  <summary>What are your weaknesses?</summary><br/>
  I am quite self-critical and unwilling to speak on details that I am not knowledgeable. Although the latter may be positive, I believe sometimes that helps create small talk and bonds through conversation. Being self-critical also is accompanied by being a perfectionist, if things aren't perfect it bugs me, but I come to terms that if I don't move on for a long period, my growth can be harmed in the process. ( Not to say being a perfectionist doesn't have its benefits ) Last I would mention here, I have a tendency to take on too much, to where I become overly stressed and worried, however I have made strides in the past year to hault this trend of mine.</details>
